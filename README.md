## Background

Future projections of sea level are important for understanding how vulnerable coastal communities will be affected worldwide. In this project, we evaluated the impact of climate change on coastal communities by using the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) as an analog for future warming, as predicted by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We examined changes in sea level worldwide due to Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) thickness changes through the Holocene using Jacky Austermannâ€™s sea level model and examined our model outputs, along with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge data.

## [NOAA Tides and Currents US Station Data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_us.html)
These datasets contains local relative sea level (RSL) trends at The Battery, New York and Nome, Alaska based on monthly mean sea level data collected by tide gauges. The tide gauge data for this project are from the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), which is a permanent network of water level monitoring stations throughout the United States maintained by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
